# CUP (Community Upgrade Project) Compatibility

## Overview
This compatibility module adds support for CUP civilian units to the Civilian Presence system.

## Purpose
Enables the use of CUP's extensive civilian populations from Chernarus, Russia, and Takistan in ambient civilian modules.

## Civilian Presets

### Chernarus Civilians (CIV_CUP_C)
- **Units**: 52 active units
- **Includes**: Assistants, bullies, citizens, doctors, functionaries, mechanics, policemen, priests, profiteers, racketeers, rescuers, rockers, school teachers, villagers, woodlanders, and workers

### Russian Civilians (CIV_CUP_R)
- **Units**: 52 active units
- **Includes**: Assistants, bullies, citizens, doctors, functionaries, mechanics, policemen, priests, profiteers, racketeers, rescuers, rockers, school teachers, villagers, woodlanders, and workers

### Takistan Civilians (CIV_CUP_TK)
- **Units**: 24 active units
- **Includes**: Various clothing combinations (coat, jacket, waist variants)

## Total Units
**128 agent classes** across 3 regional civilian presets

## Commented Out Units

### Chernarus (CIV_CUP_C)
- `CUP_C_C_AirMedic_orange_01` - Air medic with orange uniform
- `CUP_C_C_AirMedic_red_01` - Air medic with red uniform
- `CUP_C_C_AirMedic_yellow_01` - Air medic with yellow uniform
- `CUP_C_C_Fireman_01` - Fireman
- `CUP_C_C_Pilot_01` - Pilot

### Russian (CIV_CUP_R)
- `CUP_C_R_Fireman_01` - Fireman
- `CUP_C_R_Pilot_01` - Pilot

**Reason**: These specialized units (air medics, firemen, and pilots) are commented out to maintain focus on general civilian population without uniformed emergency services personnel.
